# 🎯 Task Title 02:
## "Customize Workflow for Internal Purchase Request Approval"

# ✅ Task Description:
Create or modify a workflow for an Internal Purchase Request module so that it goes through a multi-step approval process before being fully approved.

The stages should be:

Draft – Initial state when the request is created.

Waiting for Manager Approval – The first approval step.

Waiting for Finance Approval – After the manager approves.

Approved – Final approval by the finance team.

# 🎯 Learning Objectives:
The intern should:

Understand how to use and manage state fields in models.

Create buttons that move the document from one state to another.

Add proper user access control (only managers can approve at one stage, and finance at the next).

Use groups and security XML properly.

Add chatter messages (message_post) to show activity.

Build a functional form and tree view.

Optionally, use sequences to auto-generate request references.
