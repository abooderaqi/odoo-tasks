### "Customize Workflow for Internal Purchase Request Approval"

## âœ… Task Description:
Create or modify a workflow for an Internal Purchase Request module so that it goes through a multi-step approval process before being fully approved.

The stages should be:

Draft â€“ Initial state when the request is created.

Waiting for Manager Approval â€“ The first approval step.

Waiting for Finance Approval â€“ After the manager approves.

Approved â€“ Final approval by the finance team.

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives:
The intern should:

Understand how to use and manage state fields in models.

Create buttons that move the document from one state to another.

Add proper user access control (only managers can approve at one stage, and finance at the next).

Use groups and security XML properly.

Add chatter messages (message_post) to show activity.

Build a functional form and tree view.

Optionally, use sequences to auto-generate request references.

### "Create a Server Action to Update a Custom Field on Purchase Orders"
## âœ… Task Description:
Create a custom field (e.g., "Urgency Level" or "Internal Note") on the Purchase Order model. Then, build a Server Action that allows users to update this field to a specific value by selecting it from the Actions dropdown in the form view.

For example: Set "Urgency Level" to "High" when the Server Action is triggered.

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives:
Learn how to create and modify fields dynamically via server actions.

Understand how to bind server actions to models and make them user-triggered.

Reinforce knowledge of using selection fields and Odoo automation.

## ðŸ§ª Deliverables:
New field (urgency_level or similar) visible on Purchase Order form.

### "Use @api.depends and @api.onchange to Compute and Update Fields"
## âœ… Task Description:
Add a new field called total_product_qty (Float) to the Purchase Order model.

This field should compute the total quantity of all products in the order lines (order_line.product_qty).

Use @api.depends to automatically recompute this value when lines are added/modified.

Create another field called note_based_on_qty (Char).

Use @api.onchange to set a note dynamically:

If total quantity > 100 â†’ note is "Large Order"

If between 50â€“100 â†’ note is "Medium Order"

Else â†’ note is "Small Order"

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives:
Learn how to define computed fields using @api.depends.

Understand @api.onchange and how it differs from computed fields.

Practice logic branching in Python based on computed values.

Reinforce Odoo UI interaction using onchange updates.

## ðŸ§ª Deliverables:
total_product_qty computed field correctly calculating quantity sum.

note_based_on_qty updated dynamically when lines are changed.

Fields are visible in the Purchase Order form view.
